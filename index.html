<h1>Hello World</h1>

    This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

    My website is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
    
    Without me, my website is useless. Without my website, I am less useful. I must build my website well. I must build my wesite better than others have in the past. 
    
    My website and I know that what counts in life is not the quantity of creation, or the text in our paragraphs, nor the special effects we produce. We know that it is the quality.
    
    My website is product, even as I [am developer], because it is my development. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, it's strength, it's parts, it's plugins, it's code and it's formatting. I will keep my website clean and well-protected, even as I am clean and well-protected. We will become part of each other. 
    
    Before HTML5, I swear this creed.
